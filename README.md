## Guide

[Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) is an awesome CSS framework that provides a wide range of UI components. A powerful feature of Semantic UI is the ability to build various themes to each of its compoenents. For example, the Button widget comes with a varity of themes for example, flat default, basic, github, raised and many more. 

[Semantic Dojo](https://github.com/websemantics/semantic-dojo) brings these awesome features to Dojo Toolkit, allowing those who love TDK to build modern Web apps.

To test different themes for the supported widgets, go to 'less/theme.config' and change the Button theme for example from 'default' to 'raised': `@button     : 'raised';`, refresh and enjoy!
